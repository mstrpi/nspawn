<h1># nspawn</h1><p>my attempt at making systemd-nspawn installation simple, and as easy as possible. currently, this is pretty specific to my system, but am in the process of making it as open as i can feasibly do. I'm open to all advice to make this work for all</p><p>systemd-nspawn is, as described so cool-y,"chroot on steriods". Similar to docker or lxc, but built into systemd with a simple package install if not already installed. specifically systemd-container package. Setup, for me was challenging to figure out, and as with anything, more practice brought smoother seas.</p><p>this is my <strong>attempt</strong> at making the process a little bit easier for anyone wanting to try it. Again, any pointers welcome. It was fun to script, as my first attempt at scripting, and many edits later, with many more to come. hahaha.</p><h3># Thanks for reading <strong>:p</strong></h3>
