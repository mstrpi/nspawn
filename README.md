<h1># nspawn</h1>
<p>my attempt at making systemd-nspawn installation simple, and as easy as<br>
    possible. currently, this is pretty specific to my system, but am in the<br>
    process of making it as open as i can feasibly do. I'm open to all advice<br>
    to make this work for all</p><br>
<br><p>systemd-nspawn is, as described so cool-y,"chroot on steriods". Similar<br>
    to docker or lxc, but built into systemd with a simple package install if not<br>
    already installed. specifically systemd-container package. Setup, for me was<br>
    challenging to figure out, and as with anything, more practice brought smoother<br>
    seas.</p><br>
<br><p>this is my <strong>attempt</strong> at making the process a little bit<br>
	easier for anyone wanting to try it. Again, any pointers welcome. It was fun <br>
    to script, as my first attempt at scripting, and many edits later, with many<br>
    more to come. hahaha.</p><br>
